### Task

I have this username, can you help me uncover who it really is? They go by the name in2win9945 online.

### Solution

The only account I firstly found was the Twitter account with the same ID. 
It has posts with the MonkeyType account with the same ID.

There is another blog, not just in2wintyping. There was no good information for us on the first one, so let's check the second one.

There is a post named Job Hunting that says it was edited, because of the leaked personal information.

Let's look at the previous samples then.
